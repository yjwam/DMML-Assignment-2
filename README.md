# DMML-Assignment-2
## Task
The "Bag of Words" data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains five text collections in the form of bags-of-words. The URL for the UCI repository is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words.

Your task is to cluster the documents in these datasets via K-means clustering for different values of K and determine an optimum value of K.

As a similarity measure, use Jaccard index, that measures similarity between two documents based on the overlap of words present in both documents. Note that this changes the underlying model from "bag of words" to "set of words".

The datasets are of different sizes. Report your results on the three smaller datasets (Enron emails, NIPS blog entries, KOS blog entries).
